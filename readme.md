# Returning to the same old project

See also the folder `~/Documents/postGraduation/projects/learningExpFams`, which contains work that I did several years ago, as well as lab notebook titled 'Learning Cumulant Functions', which is recent.


The reason that I'm returning to this project again now is that I have a better understanding of the relationship between the base measure and partition function in natural exponential families: the partition function represents the Cumulant Generating function of the base measure itself. This raises the idea of learning this function directly from data, and using it for inference in a neural network context.
